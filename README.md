# manusmanualmapinject
Manus AI's Win 11 Manual Map Injector with Stealth Capabilities 

## Component Descriptions

### 1. Injector Controller

The main component that orchestrates the injection process:
- Parses command-line arguments
- Validates input parameters
- Coordinates the injection workflow
- Handles cleanup and resource management
- Implements architecture detection (x86/x64)

### 2. Name Randomizer

Responsible for randomizing names to avoid detection:
- Generates random DLL names
- Creates random function names
- Randomizes memory allocation sizes
- Implements timing variations

### 3. Process Interface

Manages interaction with target processes:
- Finds target processes by name or PID
- Opens process handles with minimal privileges
- Implements handle lifetime management
- Provides process information (architecture, modules, etc.)

### 4. PE File Parser

Parses and validates PE files:
- Reads DLL files from disk
- Parses PE headers (DOS, NT, Optional, Section)
- Extracts import tables, export tables, relocations
- Supports both x86 and x64 PE formats
- Validates PE file integrity

### 5. Error Handler

Provides comprehensive error handling:
- Implements detailed error codes and messages
- Logs errors (optionally)
- Ensures proper cleanup on failure
- Prevents information leakage in error messages

### 6. Memory Manager

Manages memory operations in the target process:
- Implements section-based memory allocation
- Handles memory protection changes
- Manages shared memory sections
- Implements stealthy memory writing
- Cleans up memory artifacts

### 7. Syscall Manager

Manages direct syscall operations:
- Dynamically resolves syscall numbers
- Implements direct syscall execution
- Handles syscall parameter preparation
- Implements syscall obfuscation techniques

### 8. Manual Mapper

Implements the core manual mapping functionality:
- Maps PE sections to target process
- Performs base relocations
- Handles exception directory setup
- Processes TLS callbacks
- Manages security cookie initialization

### 9. Import Resolver

Resolves DLL imports:
- Implements custom GetProcAddress functionality
- Uses hash-based function resolution
- Handles forwarded exports
- Supports delayed imports
- Implements import address table (IAT) filling

### 10. Execution Engine

Manages code execution in the target process:
- Implements thread hijacking
- Provides APC injection capability
- Supports exception-based execution
- Handles DllMain execution
- Implements cleanup after execution

## Data Flow

1. User provides DLL path and target process
2. Injector Controller validates inputs and determines architecture
3. Name Randomizer generates random identifiers
4. Process Interface locates and opens target process
5. PE File Parser reads and validates the DLL
6. Memory Manager allocates memory in target process
7. Manual Mapper maps DLL sections to target process
8. Import Resolver resolves imported functions
9. Execution Engine executes the DLL in target process
10. Error Handler manages any errors during the process
11. Injector Controller performs cleanup

## Evasion Techniques Implementation

### Memory Allocation Evasion
- Use NtCreateSection and NtMapViewOfSection instead of VirtualAllocEx
- Randomize section sizes and add padding
- Implement staggered allocations with varying protection

### Memory Writing Evasion
- Use shared memory sections to avoid WriteProcessMemory
- Implement custom memory writing using alternative APIs
- Use NtWriteVirtualMemory with obfuscated parameters

### Thread Creation Evasion
- Primary method: Thread hijacking
  - Suspend existing thread
  - Modify thread context to execute shellcode
  - Resume thread
- Fallback methods:
  - APC injection
  - Exception-based execution

### Import Resolution Evasion
- Implement hash-based function resolution
- Resolve imports at runtime in small batches
- Use timing variations during resolution

### Anti-Detection Measures
- Clean PE headers after mapping
- Encrypt all strings and decrypt only when needed
- Implement timing variations
- Remove evidence of injection after completion

## Error Handling Strategy

The error handling system uses a hierarchical approach:
- Each component has its own error codes
- Errors bubble up to the Injector Controller
- Cleanup occurs at each level on error
- Detailed error information is available but sanitized

## Randomization Strategy

Randomization occurs at multiple levels:
- File names and paths
- Memory allocation sizes and locations
- Timing between operations
- Order of non-dependent operations
- Function resolution order

## Architecture Support

The injector supports both x86 and x64 architectures:
- Automatic detection of target process architecture
- Architecture-specific PE parsing
- Architecture-specific relocation handling
- Architecture-specific shellcode generation

## Security Considerations

- Minimal privilege usage
- Clean error recovery
- Anti-forensic measures
- Self-protection mechanisms
- Avoidance of detectable patterns

## Implementation Plan

The implementation will follow this sequence:
1. Core infrastructure (error handling, randomization)
2. PE parsing functionality
3. Process interface and memory management
4. Manual mapping implementation
5. Import resolution
6. Execution engine
7. Integration and testing
