# manusmanualmapinject
Manus AI's Win 11 Manual Map Injector with Stealth Capabilities 

Component Descriptions
1. Injector Controller
The main component that orchestrates the injection process:

Parses command-line arguments
Validates input parameters
Coordinates the injection workflow
Handles cleanup and resource management
Implements architecture detection (x86/x64)
2. Name Randomizer
Responsible for randomizing names to avoid detection:

Generates random DLL names
Creates random function names
Randomizes memory allocation sizes
Implements timing variations
3. Process Interface
Manages interaction with target processes:

Finds target processes by name or PID
Opens process handles with minimal privileges
Implements handle lifetime management
Provides process information (architecture, modules, etc.)
4. PE File Parser
Parses and validates PE files:

Reads DLL files from disk
Parses PE headers (DOS, NT, Optional, Section)
Extracts import tables, export tables, relocations
Supports both x86 and x64 PE formats
Validates PE file integrity
5. Error Handler
Provides comprehensive error handling:

Implements detailed error codes and messages
Logs errors (optionally)
Ensures proper cleanup on failure
Prevents information leakage in error messages
6. Memory Manager
Manages memory operations in the target process:

Implements section-based memory allocation
Handles memory protection changes
Manages shared memory sections
Implements stealthy memory writing
Cleans up memory artifacts
7. Syscall Manager
Manages direct syscall operations:

Dynamically resolves syscall numbers
Implements direct syscall execution
Handles syscall parameter preparation
Implements syscall obfuscation techniques
8. Manual Mapper
Implements the core manual mapping functionality:

Maps PE sections to target process
Performs base relocations
Handles exception directory setup
Processes TLS callbacks
Manages security cookie initialization
9. Import Resolver
Resolves DLL imports:

Implements custom GetProcAddress functionality
Uses hash-based function resolution
Handles forwarded exports
Supports delayed imports
Implements import address table (IAT) filling
10. Execution Engine
Manages code execution in the target process:

Implements thread hijacking
Provides APC injection capability
Supports exception-based execution
Handles DllMain execution
Implements cleanup after execution
Data Flow
User provides DLL path and target process
Injector Controller validates inputs and determines architecture
Name Randomizer generates random identifiers
Process Interface locates and opens target process
PE File Parser reads and validates the DLL
Memory Manager allocates memory in target process
Manual Mapper maps DLL sections to target process
Import Resolver resolves imported functions
Execution Engine executes the DLL in target process
Error Handler manages any errors during the process
Injector Controller performs cleanup
Evasion Techniques Implementation
Memory Allocation Evasion
Use NtCreateSection and NtMapViewOfSection instead of VirtualAllocEx
Randomize section sizes and add padding
Implement staggered allocations with varying protection
Memory Writing Evasion
Use shared memory sections to avoid WriteProcessMemory
Implement custom memory writing using alternative APIs
Use NtWriteVirtualMemory with obfuscated parameters
Thread Creation Evasion
Primary method: Thread hijacking
Suspend existing thread
Modify thread context to execute shellcode
Resume thread
Fallback methods:
APC injection
Exception-based execution
Import Resolution Evasion
Implement hash-based function resolution
Resolve imports at runtime in small batches
Use timing variations during resolution
Anti-Detection Measures
Clean PE headers after mapping
Encrypt all strings and decrypt only when needed
Implement timing variations
Remove evidence of injection after completion
Error Handling Strategy
The error handling system uses a hierarchical approach:

Each component has its own error codes
Errors bubble up to the Injector Controller
Cleanup occurs at each level on error
Detailed error information is available but sanitized
Randomization Strategy
Randomization occurs at multiple levels:

File names and paths
Memory allocation sizes and locations
Timing between operations
Order of non-dependent operations
Function resolution order
Architecture Support
The injector supports both x86 and x64 architectures:

Automatic detection of target process architecture
Architecture-specific PE parsing
Architecture-specific relocation handling
Architecture-specific shellcode generation
Security Considerations
Minimal privilege usage
Clean error recovery
Anti-forensic measures
Self-protection mechanisms
Avoidance of detectable patterns
Implementation Plan
The implementation will follow this sequence:

Core infrastructure (error handling, randomization)
PE parsing functionality
Process interface and memory management
Manual mapping implementation
Import resolution
Execution engine
Integration and testing
