## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take all security vulnerabilities seriously. Thank you for helping improve the security of `[Your Project Name]`. We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

**How to Report:**

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us privately by emailing `[CONTACT METHOD FOR REPORTING VULNERABILITIES - e.g., security@yourproject.org]`. Please **do not** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, forums, or other public channels.

Please include the following details with your report:

* A clear description of the vulnerability.
* Steps to reproduce the vulnerability (include code snippets, configuration details, or specific inputs if possible).
* The version(s) of `[Your Project Name]` affected.
* Any potential impact you've identified.
* Your contact information (optional, but helpful for follow-up).

**What to Expect:**

1.  **Acknowledgement:** We will strive to acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within `[EXPECTED ACKNOWLEDGEMENT TIME - e.g., 2 business days]`.
2.  **Initial Assessment:** Our security team will investigate the report to confirm the vulnerability and determine its severity. We aim to provide an initial assessment within `[EXPECTED INITIAL ASSESSMENT TIME - e.g., 5 business days]` of acknowledgement.
3.  **Updates:** We will keep you informed of our progress as we work on a fix. You can expect periodic updates, especially if the process takes longer than anticipated.
4.  **Resolution:** Once the vulnerability is addressed, we will coordinate with you on the disclosure process, if applicable, and acknowledge your contribution (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

**Disclosure Policy:**

* **Accepted Vulnerabilities:** If the report is accepted, we will work on a fix and plan for a coordinated release and disclosure. We typically aim to release patches for critical vulnerabilities as quickly as possible.
* **Declined Vulnerabilities:** If the report is declined (e.g., it's not a vulnerability, it's a duplicate, or it's out of scope), we will explain the reasoning behind the decision.

We ask that you do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a reasonable amount of time (`[AGREED DISCLOSURE TIMEFRAME - e.g., 90 days]` from acknowledgement, unless otherwise agreed upon) to investigate and release a patch.

Thank you for helping keep `[Your Project Name]` and its users safe.
